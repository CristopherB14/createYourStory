## 📖 About the Project

**Early in the Morning** is a personal interactive fiction project built in **Twine (Harlowe 3.3.9)**.  

You step into the shoes of **Clara**, a young illustrator who spends her mornings at *La Nube*, a warm and intimate coffee shop where every cup holds a new story.  
Through a series of **branching choices**, players can shape Clara’s morning, explore her emotions, and slowly uncover the quiet magic of everyday encounters.

This story is meant to feel like a **slice-of-life visual novel** with a relaxed, romantic tone — an experiment in combining Twine’s simplicity with custom design and light narrative mechanics.
